This is my day 9 assignment where i have created a dropdown menu and by selecting the options in dropdown menu we have to change the css properties to a div

so at first i was using onclick event on the dropdown menu and then i was got to know that at select html tag onclick will not work so i have used onchange event

in this when i select options as color, background color, padding etcc it will change accordingly in the root div
